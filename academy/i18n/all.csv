base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_account_sepa_direct_debit,"
        This module enables the generation of SEPA Direct Debit (SDD)-compliant XML files (consistent
        with pain.008.001.02 specification) to send to your bank in order to
        collect a set of payments.

        To be elligible for this payment method, a customer must have first
        returned a mandate to the company, giving his consent to use direct debit.
        This consent must have been encoded as a 'customer mandate' into Odoo.

        You also need to meet the following requirements in order to properly
        generate a SDD file:
        - Your company account must be set to a valid IBAN number
        - Your company account must be associated to a bank having a valid BIC
        - Your company must have been given a creditor identifier (this can be done in the 'settings' menu of the accounting module)
        - Your company must have defined a journal to receive SDD payments (again, in 'settings' of accounting module)
        - Every customer for which you generate a payment must have a valid IBAN account number in a bank associated with a correct BIC.

        Odoo will let you know if any of these requirements are not satisfied.

        Any invoice that gets validated for a customer with a mandate will be
        automatically set in 'paid' state, and a payment will be generated. An
        option in the dashboard will then allow you to view all the payments generated
        via SDD and to generate a XML collection file for them, grouping them as
        you see fit.

        A dedicated 'SEPA Direct Debit' payment method is also available for
        open invoices, when selecting a bank account in the 'register payment' wizard.
        Use it to generate a SDD payment for the invoices if you added a mandate
        for its owner after its validation. You will see an error message if you
        try to use this method on an invoice for whose payment no mandate can be used.

    Summary: all seller-provided discounts must be applied to the Sales Price before calculating sales tax.
    Sellers should disclose their methodology to customers in a Discount Application Policy.

    The algorithm is as follows:
     - line-specific discounts are applied first, on the lines they are supposed to apply to.
       This means product-specific discounts or discounts on the cheapest line.
     - Then global discounts are applied evenly across paid lines, as much as possible.
       If there is a remainder, it is applied sequentially, in the order of the lines,
       until there is either no discount left or no discountable line left.

    Note that discount lines (with a negative price) will have no taxes applied to them,
    but rather the amount of these lines will be deduced from the lines they apply to during tax computation.

ABA Credit Transfer
===================

This module allows the generation of payment batches as ABA (Australian
Bankers Association) text files.  The generated 'aba' file can be uploaded
to many Australian banks.

Setup
-----

- *Account > Configuration > invoicing > Journals*

    If needed, create new journal or choose an existing journal with **Type**
    set to *“Bank”*.

    On **Advanced Settings**, ensure ABA Credit Transfer is ticked.

    On the **Bank Account** tab, enter the **Account Number**.

    On the same tab, ensure the ABA transfer information is set up.

    **BSB** - Required, 6 digits, and will be auto formatted.

    **Financial Institution Code** - Required (provided by bank or can be found
    on Google).  It is three uppercase 3 characters.

    **Supplying User Name** - Some banks allow this to be freeform, some banks
    may reject the ABA file if the Supplying User Name is not as expected.  It
    cannot be longer than 26 characters.

    **APCA Identification Number** - User Identification number is bank
    allocated.  It is 6 digits.

    **Include Self Balancing Transaction** - Some institutions require that the
    last be a self balancing transaction which is used as a verification.

- *Accounting > Configuration > Payments > Bank Accounts*

    Account will show up in list as the journal name.

    Editing will show the **Account Number**.  This is important as it is used by
    the ABA process.

    **Bank** is optional.

- *Contacts > Configuration > Bank Accounts > Bank Accounts*

    Paying account will show up in list as the account number.

    **Account Holder Name** - Can be entered here, if Required.  Generally not
    validated by the banks on ABA file transfers, but may show up on the payee
    bank statement against the payment.

- Vendor bank accounts can be set up in the same place, however, it is
  generally easier to set them up from the partner from for the Vendor.

- *Accounting > Vendors > Vendors*

    On **Accounting** tab, click on *""View accounts detail""* from where a
    vendor bank account can be created or edited.

    **Account Number** - Required, must be less than 9 digits.

    **BSB** - Required, 6 digits, and will be auto formatted.

    **Account Holder Name** - Optional.

Use
---

- Create a vendor payment in the normal way.

    Ensure the **Vendor** is one with a valid ABA payment account.

    Choose the correct **Payment Journal** which is set for ABA payments.

    Select **ABA Credit Transfer** radio button.

    If the vendor has multiple bank account, you may need to select the
    correct **Recipient Bank Account**.  Or if paying a vendor bill, it may
    need the correct bank account associated with it.

    Enter payment amount, etc.

- *Vendors > Payments*

    After payment(s) are confirmed, they will show up in the payments list.

    Using filters, or sorting, select the payments to be included.  Under
    *Actions* choose *Create batch payment*.

- *Vendors > Batch Payments*

    When validating a batch payment, the ABA file will be generated.  It can
    be regenerated.  This file can then be uploaded to the bank.

Add a new model named ""Identification Type"" that extend the vat field functionality in the partner and let the user to identify (an eventually invoice) to contacts not only with their fiscal tax ID (VAT) but with other types of identifications like national document, passport, foreign ID, etc. With this module installed you will see now in the partner form view two fields:

* Identification Type
* Identification Number

This behavior is a common requirement for some latam countries like Argentina and Chile. If your localization has this requirements then you need to depend on this module and define in your localization module the identifications types that are used in your country. Generally these types of identifications are defined by the government authorities that regulate the fiscal operations. For example:

* AFIP in Argentina defines DNI, CUIT (vat for legal entities), CUIL (vat for natural person), and another 80 valid identification types.

Each identification holds this information:

* name: short name of the identification
* description: could be the same short name or a long name
* country_id: the country where this identification belongs
* is_vat: identify this record as the corresponding VAT for the specific country.
* sequence: let us to sort the identification types depending on the ones that are most used.
* active: we can activate/inactivate identifications to make it easier to our customers

In order to make this module compatible for multi-company environments where we have companies that does not need/support this requirement, we have added generic identification types and generic rules to manage the contact information and make it transparent for the user when only use the VAT as we formerly know.

Generic Identifications:

* VAT: The Fiscal Tax Identification or VAT number, by default will be selected as identification type so the user will only need to add the related vat number.
* Passport
* Foreign ID (Foreign National Document)

Rules when creating a new partner: We will only see the identification types that are meaningful, taking into account these rules:

* If the partner have not country address set: Will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined in the partner's related company country (If the partner has not specific company then will show the identification types related to the current user company)

* If the partner has country address : will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined for the country of the partner.

When creating a new company, will set to the related partner always the related country is_vat identification type.

All the defined identification types can be reviewed and activate/deactivate in ""Contacts / Configuration / Identification Type"" menu.

This module is compatible with base_vat module in order to be able to validate VAT numbers for each country that have or not have the possibility to manage multiple identification types.

propagate those new data properly.

It's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to 
use Odoo properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic 
fiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 
additional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project 
https://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the 
extra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable 
Odoo modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the 
reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization 
leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies 
fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, 
accounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September 
2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't

EU Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services
=============================================================================================

As of January 1rst, 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting
and electronic services sold within the European Union
have to be always taxed in the country where the customer
belongs. In order to simplify the application of this EU
directive, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme
allows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.

This module makes it possible by helping with the creation
of the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to
automatically apply and record the required taxes.

This module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions
and taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.

The wizard lets you select:
 - the EU countries to which you are selling these
   services
 - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped
   to the target country's tax
 - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order
   to copy the account mapping. Should be your
   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults
   to no account mapping)
 - optionally: an account to use for collecting the
   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your
   national VAT tax for services)

It creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,
automatically applicable for EU sales with a customer
in the selected countries.
The wizard can be run again for adding more countries.

The wizard creates a separate Chart of Taxes for collecting the
VAT amounts of the MOSS declaration, so extracting the MOSS
data should be easy.
Look for a Chart of Taxes named ""EU MOSS VAT Chart"" in the
Taxes Report menu (Generic Accounting Report).

Be able to create journals in Odoo to create electronic customer invoices and report then to AFIP (via webserices).
The options available are:

    * Electronic Invoice - Web Service
    * Export Voucher - Web Service
    * Electronic Fiscal Bond - Web Service

In the electronic journals if you validate an invoice this one will be validated in both Odoo and AFIP. This validation is
made at the instant and we recieve and ""approved/approved with observation/rejected"" state from AFIP. If the invoice has
been rejected by AFIP will not be post in the system and a pop up message will be shown with both the error detail (reject reasons)
we recieve and a HINT about what the problem could be.

For auditing and troubleshooting purposes we also add a menu ""Consulit Invoice in AFIP"" that let us to consult invoices previously
sent to AFIP and last number used as support for any possible issues on the sequences synchronization between Odoo and AFIP.

    NOTE: From the Journal's form view we are able to force a sync between the odoo sequences to each of the document types in
    with the last numbers registered in AFIP.

From vendor bills, we have added a functionality that can be configured in the accounting settings to be able to verify
vendor bills in AFIP to check if the vendor bills are real (more information please review the setting description).

Configuration:

1. Go to the Accounting Settings > Argentinian Localization section

    1.1. Configure the AFIP Web Services mode:

    * Testing environment in order to use demo certificates that will be use to test the instance and to make NOT
      real invoices to AFIP. is just for testing. For demo instaces is already pre-defined you will not need to configure
      it (commonly named in AFIP as Homologation environment).
    * Production environment in order to generate real certificates and legal invoices to AFIP,

    1.2. Configure your AFIP Certificate: If you are in a demo instance this one will be have been set by default. If you
         are in production instance just need to go to upload your AFIP Certificate

    1.3. Optionally you can define if you like to be eable to verify vendor bills in AFIP.

2. Create Sales journals that will represent each one of your AFIP POS (Available in AFIP Portal) you want to use in Odoo.

Functional
----------

In some Latinamerica countries, including Argentina and Chile, some accounting transactions like invoices and vendor bills are classified by a document types defined by the government fiscal authorities (In Argentina case AFIP, Chile case SII).

This module is intended to be extended by localizations in order to manage these document types and is an essential information that needs to be displayed in the printed reports and that needs to be easily identified, within the set of invoices as well of account moves.

Each document type have their own rules and sequence number, this last one is integrated with the invoice number and journal sequence in order to be easy for the localization user. In order to support or not this document types a Journal has a new option that lets to use document or not.

Technical
---------

If your localization needs this logic will then need to add this module as dependency and in your localization module extend:

* extend company's _localization_use_documents() method.
* create the data of the document types that exists for the specific country. The document type has a country field

Manage 3-way matching on vendor bills
=====================================

In the manufacturing industry, people often receive the vendor bills before
receiving their purchase, but they don't want to pay the bill until the goods
have been delivered.

The solution to this situation is to create the vendor bill when you get it
(based on ordered quantities) but only pay the invoice when the received
quantities (on the PO lines) match the recorded vendor bill.

This module introduces a ""release to pay"" mechanism that marks for each vendor
bill whether it can be paid or not.

Each vendor bill receives one of the following three states:

    - Yes (The bill can be paid)
    - No (The bill cannot be paid, nothing has been delivered yet)
    - Exception (Received and invoiced quantities differ)

Manage time off requests and allocations
=====================================

This application controls the time off schedule of your company. It allows employees to request time off. Then, managers can review requests for time off and approve or reject them. This way you can control the overall time off planning for the company or department.

You can configure several kinds of time off (sickness, paid days, ...) and allocate time off to an employee or department quickly using time off allocation. An employee can also make a request for more days off by making a new time off allocation. It will increase the total of available days for that time off type (if the request is accepted).

You can keep track of time off in different ways by following reports:

* Time Off Summary
* Time Off by Department
* Time Off Analysis

A synchronization with an internal agenda (Meetings of the CRM module) is also possible in order to automatically create a meeting when a time off request is accepted by setting up a type of meeting in time off Type.

    * Foreign Currency support.
    * Support for all data record types (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).
    * Parsing & logging of all Transaction Codes and Structured Format
      Communications.
    * Automatic Financial Journal assignment via CODA configuration parameters.
    * Support for multiple Journals per Bank Account Number.
    * Support for multiple statements from different bank accounts in a single
      CODA file.
    * Support for 'parsing only' CODA Bank Accounts (defined as type='info' in
      the CODA Bank Account configuration records).
    * Multi-language CODA parsing, parsing configuration data provided for EN,
      NL, FR.

The machine readable CODA Files are parsed and stored in human readable format in
CODA Bank Statements. Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of
the CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the
creation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a
'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original
CODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting
business processes.

CODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.

A removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the
associated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank
Statements will also remove those associated statements.

Instead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also
re-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that
was missing to allow automatic reconciliation.

Remark on CODA V1 support:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured
communication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The
description provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA
V2.2 specifications.
If required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.

  other forms of automation) and makes knowledge about the
  import/export system much harder to gather as it is spread over
  3+ different projects.

* In a more extensible manner, so users and partners can build their
  own front-end to import from other file formats (e.g. OpenDocument
  files) which may be simpler to handle in their work flow or from
  their data production sources.

* In a module, so that administrators and users of Odoo who do not

Swiss localization
==================
This module defines a chart of account for Switzerland (Swiss PME/KMU 2015), taxes and enables the generation of ISR when you print an invoice or send it by mail.

An ISR will be generated if you specify the information it needs :
    - The bank account you expect to be paid on must be set, and have a valid postal reference.
    - Your invoice must have been set assigned a bank account to receive its payment
      (this can be done manually, but a default value is automatically set if you have defined a bank account).
    - You must have set the postal references of your bank.
    - Your invoice must be in EUR or CHF (as ISRs do not accept other currencies)

The generation of the ISR is automatic if you meet the previous criteria.

Here is how it works:
    - Printing the invoice will trigger the download of two files: the invoice, and its ISR
    - Clicking the 'Send by mail' button will attach two files to your draft mail : the invoice, and the corresponding ISR.

The base module to manage lunch.
================================

Many companies order sandwiches, pizzas and other, from usual vendors, for their employees to offer them more facilities.

However lunches management within the company requires proper administration especially when the number of employees or vendors is important.

Fiscal positions
----------------

When considering taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that matters.
Therefore we decided to implement the most common case in the fiscal positions: delivery is the
responsibility of the vendor and done at the customer location.

Some examples:

1) You have a customer from another province and you deliver to his location.
On the customer, set the fiscal position to his province.

2) You have a customer from another province. However this customer comes to your location
with their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.

3) An international vendor doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs
by the customs broker. On the vendor, set the fiscal position to International.

4) An international vendor charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your
position.

This is the module to manage the accounting chart for France in Odoo.
========================================================================

This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).

This localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases
(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these
'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
scenarios in fiscal positions).

This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes
and 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default
in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

Upon confirmation of a sales order or when quantities are added,
the picking that reserves from stock will be reserved if the
necessary quantities are available.

In the simplest configurations, this is an easy way of working:
first come, first served.  However, when not installed, you can
use manual reservation or run the schedulers where the system
will take into account the expected date and the priority.

If this automatic reservation would reserve too much, you can
still unreserve a picking.

VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
=========================================

After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
will be validated using the Belgian rules.

There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
--------------------------------------------------------
    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and 
      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
      or not valid anymore.

    * When the ""VAT VIES Check"" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
      instead.

Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
only the country code will be validated.

===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers that have Python's ``python-ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
General Settings menu. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in Odoo, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

Odoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups

===================================================

Add the financial reports to Mexican Electronic Invoice

- COA
- Trial Balance
- Journal Items

Add other operative reports like DIOT.

- DIOT

Known leak of features:

- Save the generated xml in order to make available an history of Fiscal declared documents.
- Unit tests to increase the coverage of this module and avoid regressions in the future.

Notes:
------

  - In the taxes could be set the account `Base Tax Received Account` that is the
    account that will be set on lines created in cash basis journal entry and
    used to keep track of the tax base amount, this account is not considered in
    the Mexican reports.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, it is strongly recommended your chart of account depends of the l10n_mx data and structure,
you can set this afterwards if you CoA do not depends of what l10n_mx does, but you will need extra manual work.

==================================================

Ce module permet de générer le fichier FEC tel que définit par `l'arrêté du 29
Juillet 2013 <http://legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2013/7/29/BUDE1315492A/jo/texte>`
portant modification des dispositions de l'article A. 47 A-1 du
livre des procédures fiscales.

Cet arrêté prévoit l'obligation pour les sociétés ayant une comptabilité
informatisée de pouvoir fournir à l'administration fiscale un fichier
regroupant l'ensemble des écritures comptables de l'exercice. Le format de ce
fichier, appelé *FEC*, est définit dans l'arrêté.

Le détail du format du FEC est spécifié dans le bulletin officiel des finances publiques `BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213 <http://bofip.impots.gouv.fr/bofip/ext/pdf/createPdfWithAnnexePermalien/BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213.pdf?doc=9028-PGP&identifiant=BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213>` du 13 Décembre 2013. Ce module implémente le fichier
FEC au format texte et non au format XML, car le format texte sera facilement
lisible et vérifiable par le comptable en utilisant un tableur.

La structure du fichier FEC généré par ce module a été vérifiée avec le logiciel
*Test Compta Demat* version 1_00_05 disponible sur
`le site de la direction générale des finances publiques <http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgfip/outil-test-des-fichiers-des-ecritures-comptables-fec>`
en utilisant une base de donnée Odoo réelle.

Configuration
=============

Aucune configuration n'est nécessaire.

Utilisation
===========

Pour générer le *FEC*, allez dans le menu *Accounting > Reporting > French Statements > FEC* qui va démarrer l'assistant de génération du FEC.

Chart of account:
-----------------

The tree of the CoA is done using account groups, all the accounts with move
are available as groups but only the more common ones are available as actual
accounts, if you want to create a new one use the group of accounts as
reference.

We added on this module the 3 concepts in taxes (necessary for the EDI
signature)

# TODO: Describe new fields.

Products:

**Nota:**
---------

**RELACIÓN ENTRE EL PCGE Y LA LEGISLACIÓN TRIBUTARIA:**

Este PCGE ha sido preparado como una herramienta de carácter contable, para acumular información que 
requiere ser expuesta en el cuerpo de los estados financieros o en las notas a dichos estados. Esa acumulación se 
efectúa en los libros o registros contables, cuya denominación y naturaleza depende de las actividades que se 
efectúen, y que permiten acciones de verificación, control y seguimiento. Las NIIF completas y la NIIF PYMES no
contienen prescripciones sobre teneduría de libros, y consecuentemente, sobre los libros y otros registros 
de naturaleza contable. Por otro lado, si bien es cierto la contabilidad es también un insumo, dentro de otros, para 
labores de cumplimiento tributario, este PCGE no ha sido elaborado para satisfacer prescripciones tributarias ni su 
verificación. No obstante ello, donde no hubo oposición entre la contabilidad financiera prescrita por las NIIF y
la legislación tributaria, este PCGE ha incluido subcuentas, divisionarias y sub divisionarias, para
distinguir componentes con validez tributaria, dentro del conjunto de componentes que corresponden a una
perspectiva contable íntegramente. Por lo tanto, este PCGE no debe ser considerado en ningún aspecto
como una guía con propósitos distintos del contable.",,

------------------

### Infinitely flexible. Incredibly easy to use.


Odoo's collaborative and realtime <a href=""https://www.odoo.com/page/project-management"">open source project management</a>
helps your team get work done. Keep track of everything, from the big picture
to the minute details, from the customer contract to the billing.

Designed to fit your own process
--------------------------------

Organize projects around your own processes. Work on tasks and issues using the
kanban view, schedule tasks using the gantt chart and control deadlines in the
calendar view. Every project may have it's own stages allowing teams to
optimize their job.

Easy to use
-----------

Get organized as fast as you can think. The easy-to-use interface takes no time
to learn, and every action is instantaneous, so there’s nothing standing
between you and your sweet productive flow.

Work Together
-------------

### Real time chats, document sharing, email integration

Use open chatter to communicate with your team or customers and share comments
and documents on tasks and issues. Integrate discussion fast with the email
integration.

Talk to others users or customers with the website live chat feature.

Collaborative Writing
---------------------

### The power of etherpad, inside your tasks

Collaboratively edit the same specifications or meeting minutes right inside
the application. The incorporated etherpad feature allows several people to
work on the same tasks, at the same time.

This is very efficient for scrum meetings, meeting minutes or complex
specifications. Every user has their own color and you can replay the whole
creation of the content.

Get Work Done
-------------

Get alerts on followed events to stay up to date with what interests you. Use
instant green/red visual indicators to scan through what has been done and what
requires your attention.

Timesheets, Contracts & Invoicing
---------------------------------

Projects are automatically integrated with customer contracts allowing you to
invoice based on time & materials and record timesheets easily.

Track Issues
------------

Single out the issues that arise in a project in order to have a better focus
on resolving them. Integrate customer interaction on every issue and get
accurate reports on your team's performance.
